# Template
Template  for class submissions

There will be 3 main folders: Homeworks, Quizzes, and Project Assignmments. There  will be subfolders. creat subfolders as in  this template
under the main folders. Place your documents (zip, Word, PDF, PPT, .jpeg, .html, .css, js, etc., ) in these subfolders. You can organize on
your desktop and synchronize. I will demmo this in the class of 9/21/16.  

Github was developed mainly to track code  development in a group environment. Your project folder can be cloned directly here at the same level of the main folders. This will ensure that Github versioning and other functionalities are available to your project folder. For this,
you may have to copy the contents (not the pareent folder) directly into your desktop folder. Or, better  yet, you  can  maintain a separate tab at Github for that. More on this soon!
