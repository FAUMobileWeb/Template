Develop a storyboard of your app using Balsamiq mockups. (1). Launch the book app in Chapter 7 to see the final app that the book develops (Actually, it continues beyond that with incorporation of the server side for cloud backup and computing, in Chapter 8; it can be incorporated later on). Launch the app on your mobilephone to get a feel for the focus on content and minimal style. There is no place for verbose discussion - just the facts! (2). Go to the Balsamiq site and develop your storyboard. Here are links to some articles/guidelines on storyboards: http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/10-tips-for-creating-storyboards-from-dreamworks/ , http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/storyboarding-like-a-pro/  , and http://bit.ly/2cUZmQY . This needs to be a collaborative effort. Much from the text book example can be adopted. You are welcome to make your own creative variations. Find appropriates subject content, images, videos, and URLs from the web and note them down in your Github readme document. For your final app, you cannot use any copyrighted material; but you could them here in your readme file - just as ideas to follow up on. At a later time, I can request graphics students to contribute material helpful to you; but you need to decide soon. Also, I plan to invite a nursing professor to come as a guest speaker to help you find health related material (after the 8th week of classes). (3) Download your .bmml file(s) from your Balsamiq site and upload to your Github site. See below for details on that.

What to submit: Upload your .bmml file from your Balsamiq site (fau.mybalsmiq.cm) to the Github site. Post it under the ProjectAssignments/PA1 subfolder. Add  a readme.md file there providing a brief description of the storyboard. Provide a link at Blackboard for your submission. Identify with a proper label: PA1_TeamTopic_Date.

Examples: Check out the Github site corresponding subfolder of Template Repo: I have uploaded a few mockups from this summer high school program for you to look at. These can be directly opened in Balsamiq (note their .bmml extension). These are from the top three groups of summer high school students: To Fly, Powerful You, and Go Green. You may find their final apps and code at https://github.com/MODS16Apps.  You can upload to your mybalsamiq account and open them there. Or, download this reader to your PC and use it: https://balsamiq.com/download/ . Note that it may have a nagging popup to register. Hit "enter" and ignore it.
